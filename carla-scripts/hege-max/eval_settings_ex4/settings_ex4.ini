# Route format:
# Each route is separated by a space.
# Each route is an array with waypoints: (int spawnpointId, int nextHlc) tuple values
# spawnpointId refers to the ID of one of the map's predefined spawn points. It defines the localtion of the waypoint
# nextHlc specifies which HLC to be set when reaching this waypoint. It helps the agent navigate.
